NOTES TO SELF
*Change filename format to prevent overwrites (DONE)
*Prevent hashed password from being sent to user after successful registration 
Set expiration time on JWT token (TBC after development)
*Implement validation functions (in validation.js) for routes in api.js (Probably unnecessary, needs pen test)
Check for cross-site scripting
*Make sure user id's are not visible to the client (Probably fixed, needs testing)
*Prevent images from saving without database entry being created. (DONE)
